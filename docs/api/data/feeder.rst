Data feeder
===========

Data feeders offer an efficient pipeline for supplying batches of input samples during model training and validation. They ...

* read prepared data from disk,
* apply transformation (if any) to the data,
* perform on-the-fly data augmentations (if any),
* cache, shuffle and batch input samples, and
* present the batched samples to the model.

For most common applications in bioacoustics, :class:`~koogu.data.feeder.SpectralDataFeeder` offers a convenient way to convert prepared audio clips into spectrograms on-the-fly during training/validation. :class:`~koogu.data.feeder.DataFeeder` does not apply any transformations and feeds audio clips as-is. Both these classes may be extended to add additional functionalities, change or add new transformation functions, and to include on-the-fly :doc:`data augmentations <augmentation>`.

For processing prepared data generated by mechanisms outside of Koogu, extend :class:`koogu.data.feeder.BaseFeeder` to implement custom logic to feed your data into the Koogu training pipeline.
